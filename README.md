![sql.png](sql.png)

## My Work

* A situation where I have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard.

* My Major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are 6 CSV files.

* In this challenge work, I will design the tables in postgresql to hold data in the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

* I will perform: Data Engineering (a.k.a. Data Modeling) and Data Analysis.

* Later, I will add Jupyter Notebook that contains the graphs of the employees data.
